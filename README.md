# README

+   inspired by [ChristianChiarulli/nvim.git](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/nvim.git)
    +   that was a bit like wanting to drive a stick and being handed the keys to a Formula-One
+   developing in mainline  but will tag commits of interest

## My Ops Notes

+   :PackerUpdate will rebuild plugins if necessary
    +   nvim -c PackerUpdate will do it from CLI

## TODO

+   integrating PHAN with LSP may require installing PHAN in a project directory
