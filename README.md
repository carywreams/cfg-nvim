# README

+   inspired by [ChristianChiarulli/nvim.git](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/nvim.git)
    +   that was a bit like wanting to drive a stick and being handed the keys to a Formula-One
+   developing in mainline  but will tag commits of interest

## LSP Notes

### Server #1: jsonls

+ Additional Needs 
  + npm install -g vscode-langservers-extracted
  + nvim-gps
  + lualine
+ To Do 
  + status line messages still  not  appearing


## My Ops Notes

+   :PackerUpdate will rebuild plugins if necessary
    +   nvim -c PackerUpdate will do it from CLI

## TODO

+   integrating PHAN with LSP may require installing PHAN in a project directory
